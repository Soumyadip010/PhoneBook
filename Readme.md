    üõ† Requirements

        Oracle Database with a proper connection string
        ojdbc14.jar: Oracle JDBC driver (already referenced in .idea/libraries/)

Database Schema:-

        CREATE TABLE CONTACTS (
            ID NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
            NAME VARCHAR2(100),
            PHONE_NUMBER NUMBER(15),
            EMAIL VARCHAR2(100),
            ADDRESS VARCHAR2(100)
            PRIMARY KEY (ID)
        );
        
üöÄ How to Run
Clone or Download the Project

    git clone https://github.com/Soumyadip010/PhoneBook.git
    cd PhoneBook
    Configure Oracle DB Connection
    Update the database URL, username, and password in DBConnection.java.

||Compile the Project||

        javac -d out/production/PhoneBook src/**/*.java
||Run the Application||

        java -cp out/production/PhoneBook main

üìå Notes:-<br>
    Ensure Oracle Database is running before starting the app.<br>
    The application stores contact numbers as BigDecimal to handle very large values.<br>
    UI is minimal as it's based on AWT but functionally complete.<br>
