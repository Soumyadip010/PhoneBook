    JDK: 8 or higher
    Oracle Database with a proper connection string
    ojdbc14.jar: Oracle JDBC driver (already referenced in .idea/libraries/)

Database Schema:-
    CREATE TABLE CONTACTS (
        ID NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
        NAME VARCHAR2(100),
        PHONE_NUMBER NUMBER(15),
        EMAIL VARCHAR2(100),
        PRIMARY KEY (ID)
    );

üöÄ How to Run
Clone or Download the Project

git clone https://github.com/Soumyadip010/Phonebook.git
cd PhoneBook
Configure Oracle DB Connection

Update the database URL, username, and password in DBConnection.java.

||Compile the Project||
    javac -d out/production/PhoneBook src/**/*.java

||Run the Application||
    java -cp out/production/PhoneBook main

üìå Notes
    Ensure Oracle Database is running before starting the app.
    The application stores contact numbers as BigDecimal to handle very large values.
    UI is minimal as it's based on AWT but functionally complete.
